# TwitterSentiment


trying out azure text analytics



using tweeinvi's package to manipulate twitter api, this program captures a stream of tweets matching the filters trump/biden. Using microsoft azure text analytics, a nlp program, we analyze the tweets to measure sentiments.


 ## Future features
 
- [ ]  aggregate the tweets so as to find a balance between the two filters ie having equal amount of tweets for the 2 filters.
- [ ]  color the tweets appropriately, red for negative, green for positive.
- [ ]  a better stop condition, instead of ctrl - c.
- [ ]  export to a db/excel sheet. ( in progress)
- [ ]  use Tableau for data visualization.
